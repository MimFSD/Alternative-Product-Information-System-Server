## Introduction

The **Next-Generation Product Catalog and Data Integration Hub** is a backend service designed to manage complex product catalogs and facilitate seamless data integration across multiple platforms. It enables real-time data synchronization, supports robust data handling, and offers API endpoints for CRUD operations on product data, categories, and metadata.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Catalog Management**: Easily create, update, and manage product data.
- **Data Integration**: Integrate with multiple data sources, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Automatic syncing of data between platforms and services.
- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Full-text search, faceted filtering, and custom queries.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports scaling and handling large datasets.
- **Secure API Endpoints**: JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Centralized error management and detailed logging.

## Technologies

- **Node.js** - Backend runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework for building the REST API
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for storing product data
- **Mongoose** - ODM library for MongoDB
- **Redis** - In-memory data structure store for caching and message brokering
- **RabbitMQ** - Messaging broker for handling asynchronous data processing
- **Elasticsearch** - Search engine for advanced search and filtering capabilities
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - Authentication and authorization
- **Winston** - Logging library

## Architecture

The server application follows a microservices-oriented architecture, allowing independent scaling of services such as:

- **Product Service**: Manages all CRUD operations related to product data.
- **Integration Service**: Handles data synchronization and integration with external systems.
- **Search Service**: Manages indexing and search functionality using Elasticsearch.
- **Caching Layer**: Utilizes Redis for caching frequently accessed data.

## Installation

| GET    | `/api/products`         | Fetch all products                         |
| GET    | `/api/products/:id`     | Fetch a specific product by ID             |
| POST   | `/api/products`         | Create a new product                       |
| PUT    | `/api/products/:id`     | Update a product by ID                     |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id`     | Delete a product by ID                     |
| GET    | `/api/categories`       | Fetch all product categories               |
| POST   | `/api/sync`             | Trigger data synchronization with sources  |

## Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are configured in the `.env` file:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri

- Let's create cookie options for both the production and local server

```
const cookieOptions = {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  sameSite: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "none" : "strict",
};
//localhost:5000 and localhost:5173 are treated as same site.  so sameSite value must be strict in the development server.  in production, sameSite will be none
// in development server secure will false.  in production secure will be true
```

- now we can use this object for the cookie option to modify cookies

```
//creating Token
app.post("/jwt", logger, async (req, res) => {
  const user = req.body;
  console.log("user for token", user);
  const token = jwt.sign(user, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET);

  res.cookie("token", token, cookieOptions).send({ success: true });
});

//clearing Token
app.post("/logout", async (req, res) => {
  const user = req.body;
  console.log("logging out", user);
  res
    .clearCookie("token", { ...cookieOptions, maxAge: 0 })
    .send({ success: true });
});
```



<!-- # Alternative Product Information System Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of the Alternative Product Information System project! This repository contains the backend server code built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## Key Features

1. **User Product Posting**: Users can post pictures and details (name, brand, query) of products they do not like.
2. **Recommendations**: Users can receive recommendations for better alternatives based on the products they dislike.
3. **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes JWT tokens for secure user authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access certain features.
4. **CRUD Operations**: Provides endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing posts and recommendations.
5. **Data Separation**: Backend API endpoints are structured to handle post data, recommendation data, and user authentication separately.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and product data.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **Other npm Packages**: Used for various functionalities like data validation, error handling, etc.
